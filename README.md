# YugSmriti

A historical time capsule application, winner of CSI-TSEC's Rubix 2025.

## Problem Statement
Learning history through textbooks often lacks engagement and interactivity. This project aims to develop a web-based Virtual Historical Time Machine, allowing users to explore different eras through interactive timelines, 3D models, and multimedia content. The platform will provide an immersive, educational, and visually engaging way to experience historical events, cultures, and innovations.
### Main Features(checked for implemented in app, others are in the website):
- [ ] Interactive Timeline Navigation – Users can scroll through different historical periods and select specific events or civilizations.
- [ ] Interactive Maps – Include interactive historical maps that allow users to explore how borders, civilizations, and landmarks changed over time.
- [ ] Multimedia Storytelling – Integrate audio narrations, videos, and animations to bring historical events to life.
- [ ] Thematic Time Travel Modes – Users can choose specific themes (e.g., Ancient Civilizations, Industrial Revolution, World Wars) to explore history from different perspectives.
- [ ] Historical Figures & AI Chatbots – Engage with AI-powered characters representing famous historical figures for interactive learning.
- [x] Gamified Quests & Challenges – Users can participate in trivia, puzzles, or scavenger hunts related to historical events.
- [x] Social Sharing & Community Features – Enable users to share interesting historical facts, achievements, or progress on social media or in an integrated community forum for discussions on history.

### USPs implemented: 
- AR based landmark navigation
- Ancient language translator

### TODO:
- Release assets after crediting the authors
- Fix the release build pipeline and release an APK
